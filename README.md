# PURSUE C++ Workshop 
This repository holds all of the material & links which will be used in the PURSUE Scikit-C++ tutorial. The main source of information which will be used will be the lecture notes included in this repo. These were developed using an assortment of excelent learning material, namely:

* [HSF Basic Moden C++ Tutorial](https://hsf-training.github.io/hsf-training-cpp-webpage/) (Note: Unfinished)
* [C++ Language Tutorial](https://cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial/)
* [HSF C++ Course](https://github.com/hsf-training/cpluspluscourse)

The notes provided here are not meant to serve as a guide and as a quick reference.

# Set-up
## GitHub Codespace
From this repository, open a GitHub Codespace by either

* Hitting the `.` button.
* Clicking [here](https://github.dev/roy-cruz/PURSUE-scikithep).

Once the page loads, click on the blue "GitHub" button on the bottom left, and select "Continue Working in GitHub Codespaces" in the drop down menu that appears. Once your Codespace finishes loading, open the terminal (upper right corner). To make sure you have access to the copiler, just use the command

```bash
g++ -h
```

If the help documentation comes up, you are ready to go!

## C++ Shell
If Codespace is not working for you, you can also use the [C++ shell](https://cpp.sh/) website. Note, however, that this option is limited in its functionality, as you will not be able to use header files (more on that in the tutorial).
