# Chapter 4: Functions & Memory

In this chapter, we will explore functions in C++. We will start by building on what we covered in Chapter 2 and then expand to cover concepts unique to C++. We'll also discuss memory allocation, pointers, and the differences between passing by reference and passing by value.

## What We Saw Before

In Chapter 2, we introduced the basics of functions in C++. We saw that the definition of a function has two components: 
* Function declaration: Tells the compiler about a function's name, return type, and parameters.
* Definition: Provides the actual body of the function.

Example in Python:
```python
def add(a, b):
    return a + b

result = add(3, 4)
print(result)
```

Equivalent in C++:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

// Function declaration
int add(int a, int b);

// Function definition
int add(int a, int b) {
    return a + b;
}

int main() {
    int result = add(3, 4);
    cout << result << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

## Default Arguments and Function Overloading

In C++, just like in Python, you can have arguments in your functions which have a default value. The syntax is nearly identical. For instance, we can have the following:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
using namespace std;

void greet(string name = "User") {
    cout << "Hello, " << name << "!" << end;
}

int main () {
    greet();
    greet("Alice");
    return 0;
}
```

Additionally, we can have define multiple distinct functions with the same name. In order for C++ to distinguish them, we must use different parameters for each of these functions. Example:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int add(int a, int b) {
    return a + b;
}

double add(double a, double b) {
    return a + b;
}

int main() {
    cout << add(3, 4) << endl;
    cout << add(3.5, 4.5) << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

In this exmaple, C++ is able to understand which `add` function we are referring to because when we do `add(3, 4)`, we are passing `int` values, so it corresponds to the first function definition, whereas when we do `add(3.5, 4.5)` we are passing floats `double` typed values, corresponding to the second function definition.

## Passing by Reference vs. Passing by Value

### Pointers

Whenever you create a variable in C++, you are doing a couple of things:

1. Allocating Memory:
   * You are allocating a space in memory of the size appropriate for the type of the variable. This space in memory is reserved to store the value of the variable.
   * For instance, creating an `int` variable allocates 4 bytes of memory on most systems.
2. Creating a Variable:
   * You are creating a variable that contains the value stored in the allocated memory space.
   * Each variable has a particular memory address, which is the location in memory where the value is stored. You can access this memory address using the address-of operator `&`. For instance, if I declare `int x = 4`, and I then do `&x`, I will get the address in memory of `x`, which is usually represented as a hexadecimal number such as `0x16b671738`.

A pointer is a variables that store memory addresses. They are powerful, but you need to be careful when you handle them. This is the power of C++: it trusts you with direct access to the memory. Use that that level of control carefully! Otherwise, you might end up having errors such as memory leaks and segmentation fauls.

### Passing by Value vs. Passing by Reference

So far, we have seen that we can pass arguments to a function and that function can perform some operations with that data. However, this "standard" way of passing values to a function is such that any change to the information you pass to the function is lost once you are outside the scope of the function unless you return this information. If you run the following code, you will see this in effect.

```{literalinclude} ../examples_cpp/c4_passbyval.cpp
:language: cpp
:lineno-match:
```

Passing a parameter to a function in this way is called passing by value because, as the name suggests, you are passing the value or contents of the variable, but not the memory address itself which would allow the function to access the data you passed to it.

If we wish to provide the function access to the data in memory instead of giving it a copy of the data, we would need to pass by reference. This can be achieved by changing the header of the function to `void passByValue(int& val)`. `int&` denotes a reference to an integer, which means that `val` will be an alias of the original variable instead of just a copy of it. The code and output would look as such:

```{literalinclude} ../examples_cpp/c4_passbyref.cpp
:language: cpp
:lineno-match:
```

Another way to achieve this effect is to pass the address in memory of the variable, i.e. the pointer. The following example shows how to do this.

```{literalinclude} ../examples_cpp/c4_passbypoint.cpp
:language: cpp
:lineno-match:
```

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int var = 42;
    int* ptr = &var;

    cout << "Value of var: " << var << endl;
    cout << "Address of var: " << ptr << endl;
    cout << "Value pointed to by ptr: " << *ptr << endl;

    return 0;
}
```
<!-- 
#### 
Dynamic memory allocation allows you to allocate memory during runtime using the `new` operator and deallocate it using the `delete` operator.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int* dynamicInt = new int(5);  // Dynamically allocate memory for an integer
    cout << "Value of dynamicInt: " << *dynamicInt << endl;
    delete dynamicInt;  // Free the allocated memory

    int* dynamicArray = new int[5];  // Dynamically allocate memory for an array
    for (int i = 0; i < 5; ++i) {
        dynamicArray[i] = i * 10;
        cout << "dynamicArray[" << i << "] = " << dynamicArray[i] << endl;
    }
    delete[] dynamicArray;  // Free the allocated memory

    return 0;
}
```

### Passing by Value vs. Passing by Reference

#### Passing by Value
When passing by value, a copy of the argument is passed to the function. Modifications to the parameter inside the function do not affect the original argument.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

void passByValue(int val) {
    val = 20;  // This modification won't affect the original argument
}

int main() {
    int a = 10;
    passByValue(a);
    cout << "After passByValue, a = " << a << endl;  // Output: 10
    return 0;
}
```

#### Passing by Reference
When passing by reference, the function receives a reference to the original argument, allowing it to modify the argument's value.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

void passByReference(int& ref) {
    ref = 20;  // This modification will affect the original argument
}

int main() {
    int b = 10;
    passByReference(b);
    cout << "After passByReference, b = " << b << endl;  // Output: 20
    return 0;
}
``` -->
<!-- 
#### Passing by Pointer
Pointers can also be used to pass arguments by reference, providing similar functionality with explicit memory address handling.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

void passByPointer(int* ptr) {
    *ptr = 20;  // This modification will affect the original argument
}

int main() {
    int c = 10;
    passByPointer(&c);
    cout << "After passByPointer, c = " << c << endl;  // Output: 20
    return 0;
}
```
