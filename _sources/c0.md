# Set-up

The main modalities which we will use to execute the examples presented in this session, as well as to do the exercises assigned will be the use of a CMSSW enviornment in the CMS-LPC cluster, and a local compiler. Use whichever one is most convenient for you to use. If, however, you find that neither of these work for you in time for the session, as a last resort, you can also use the [C++ Shell](https://cpp.sh/) website. This options has its limitations in that it cannot make use of user constructed header files, but it will suffice most of the rest of the material presented.

## CMS-LPC Cluster

Add the following to your `~/.ssh/config` file

```
Host cmslpc-*.fnal.gov
    StrictHostKeyChecking no
    UserKnownHostsFile /dev/null
```

and log into the LPC cluster. Once there, run the following commands

```{code} bash
mkdir nobackup/PURSUE-CPP
cd nobackup/PURSUE-CPP
cmsrel CMSSW_12_4_19
cd CMSSW_12_4_19/src/
cmsenv
git clone git@github.com:roy-cruz/PURSUE-cpp.git
cd PURSUE-cpp
```

To test that everything is working, compile and run `helloworld.cpp`.

```cpp
cd examples_cpp
g++ helloworld.cpp -o helloworld
./helloworld
```

If you get the following output, you are ready to go!

```cpp
Hello World 0
Hello World 1
Hello World 2
```

## Local

Your machine should already have the CPP compiler. To make sure that this is the case, run `g++`. If it complains about the command not being found, run the following to install it (assuming you are using AlmaLinux9):

```bash
sudo yum install gcc-c++
```

Next, clone this repository

```bash
git clone git@github.com:roy-cruz/PURSUE-cpp.git
cd PURSUE-cpp
```

and test that everything is working by compiling and running `helloworld.cpp`.

```cpp
cd examples_cpp
g++ helloworld.cpp -o helloworld
./helloworld
```

If you get the following output, you are ready to go!

```cpp
Hello World 0
Hello World 1
Hello World 2
```
