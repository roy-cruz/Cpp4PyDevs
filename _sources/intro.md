# Introduction

This page holds all the lecture notes which will be used to guide the PURSUE C++ tutorial session. The material itself is based upon the assumption that the students have had some previous exposure to Python. From this understanding, we will construct the basics of C++ by starting with the similarities between C++ and Python. Afterwards, we will begin to develop C++ on its own, considering those parts that make it fundamentally distinct from Python. At the very end of the tutorial, we will analyze an example of the use of C++ in HEP.

The material developed here is partially based on the following tutorials. If you wish to have a deeper look into C++, I highly recommend you check these out in your own time.
