# Chapter 2: From Python to C++

In this chapter, we will be introducing the fundamental things you will need to get strated coding in C++ by seeing how basic elements from Python such as variables, flow control and functions look like in C++. At the end, we will look at a some more complex examples comparing C++ and Python and you will work on an exercise applying all of this in order to write your first program in C++. Keep in mind that the difference between Python and C++ are not just syntax. While the same program written in C++ and in Python might technically work the same, they will operate differently under the hood.

## First Things First...

Before we can jump into programming in C++, we need to do some neccesary housekeeping. Consider the following, very simple code in Python.

```{literalinclude} ../examples_py/c2_pyeg.py
:language: py
:lineno-match:
```

If we were to translate this into C++, it would look something like the following.


```{literalinclude} ../examples_cpp/c2_cppeg.cpp
:language: cpp
:lineno-match:
```

Let's go line by line to understand the elements introduced by C++ in this example:
* Line 1-2:
  * The `#include <iostream>` is called a preprocessor directive. Think of this as `import` in Python. In this case its "importing" `iostream`, which is part of the standard library and includes tools to read and write text to/from the console such as `cout` and `cin`.
  * In C++, code is organized into namespaces. In practice, this allows us to have functions with the same name. For instance, I could have a namespace called `space1` and another `space2`, both of which have a function defined within them called `func` and I could use them both in my code by specifying which namespace I am referring to when I call the function `func`.
    ```cpp
    space1::func();
    space2::func();
    ```
  * By specifying that we are using the namespace `std`, we avoid having to specifying that `cout`, which is part of the `std` namespace, indeed comes from said namespace. If line 2 was not there, we would need to write `std::cout`.
* Line 4
  * This line is a function header for a function called `main` which is we indicate will return a value of type `int`. This function is fundamental because **every C++ program starts by running the `main` function**.
  * Unlike in Python where we indicate that a set of statements are part of a function by indenting them with respect to the function header, in C++ we indicate this by having these statements enclosed by `{}`. 
* Lines 5 to 10
  * These lines define the body of the function `main`.
  * Notice that each statement ends in `;`. This tells the compiler that that is the end of that particular statement. This is neccesary to add because, unlike Python, C++ is a *whitespace-independent language* which means that the following two snippets of code are completely equivalent to the compiler and thus, without `;`, there would be no way for the compiler to know that it had reached the end of a statement.
  ```cpp
  int main() {
    int x = 2;
    int y = 4;
    return 0;
  }
  ```
  ```cpp
  int main(){int x=2;int y=4;return 0;}
  ```

We will discuss the rest of the elements seen in the code snipper as we go along, but take some time to try to deduce what each part is doing.

## Variables and Types

In Python, if you want to define a variable of type `int` you simply need to write `x = 2`, and the interpreter will infer the type. This is because Python is a **dynamically typed** language, which means that type checking and type assignment of variables happens at runtime and the type of a variable will be based on the value assigned to it. This also means that we can declare a variable to have a value of a particular type, but then assign it a value of a different type. For instance, the following is valid in Python.

```python
x = 2
x = "This is a string!"
```

C++, however, is a statically typed language. This means that type assignment and checking is done at *compile time* and that, when we declare a variable, we must specify its type and that this type is unchanging. Thus the following works

```cpp
int x = 5;
x = 6;
```

but this will cause an error when you attempt to compile

```cpp
int x = 5;
x = 0.45; // Not an integer!
```

Note that, just like in Python has some reserved keyword which you would not want to name your variables (e.g. `print` is a terrible name for a variable!), C++ also has a set of reserved names. For instance, if you try to call a variable `return`, the compiler will complain. You can ready more about these reserved keywords [here](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/keyword). In addition to these restrictions, C++ has other rules for what variable names are valid. In order for an identifier to be valid, it must obey the following conditions:
  * It must be a sequence of one or more letters, digits, or underscore
  * It must NOT include spaces, punctuation marks & symbols
  * It must ALWAYS begin with letter or underscore (though the latter is usually reserved for special purposes)
  * It must NOT be one of the reserved keywords in C++ 

The following table shows some of the data types found in C++ which you might find most familiar having some knowledge of Python. Note that there are more data types than these which we will see later, but these will at least get you started.

## C++ vs. Python

* Despite Python and C++ being fundamentally different in that one is an interpreted language and the other is a compiled language, the knowledge you already have gathered from the former is very portable to this new context. However, there are some immediate practical differences we need to keep in mind.
  * In C++, you first need to compile your source code. This will produce an output executible which you can then run. In Python, you can just feed the source code into the interpreter and it will just run.
  * In Python, you can declare a variable like `a = 5`, and, through context, the interpreter will understand that `a` is supposed to be of type `int`. However, in C++ you need to explicitly tell the compiler what type of data a variable is supposed to represent. For example, to do the same assignment, we would need to do `int a = 5`.
  * Python and C++ are syntactically distinct. For instance, in C++, you need to finish every line of code with a `;`. We will see other differences later.
  * In C++, you have more direct access to memory, while in Python this is mostly taken care of behind the scenes.
  * In Python, you define a block a code through indentation. For instance, you do indicate to the interpreter that a set of statements should be inside of an `if`, we would use indentation.
    ```python
    if x = 2:
      x = x / 2
      print("The number is: ", x)
    ```
    However, C++ does not enforce any sort of formatting restrictions and in a *whitespace-independent language*. This means that this (ignore what the code actually does for now)
    ```cpp
    if (x==2) {

      x = x / 2;

      std::cout << "The number is: " << x;

    }
    ```

    is completely equivalent to

    ```cpp
    if(x==2){x=x/2;std::cout<<"The number is: "<<x;}
    ```
    
    However, its evidently bad practice to write your code like in the latter example! In fact, there are a bunch of conventions and styles defined that you should follow to make your code accesible. Some commonly referenced style guides are:
      * [C++ Core Guidelines](http://isocpp.github.io/CppCoreGuidelines/CppCoreGuidelines)
      * [Google](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html)
      * [LLVM](https://llvm.org/docs/CodingStandards.html)
      * [GCC/GNU](https://gcc.gnu.org/codingconventions.html)


* We will kick our introduction to C++ by building upon the exposure you have already had to Python. This is a common theme in programming: once you know a programming language, learning any other becomes exponentially easier.
* In the following chapters, we will begin formally introducing some of those intricacies which differentiate C++ from Python beyond the differences in syntax.
