# Chapter 7: Advanced Topics in C++

In this chapter, we will introduce a set of elements from C++ which do not neatly fit into any of the other, basics-focused chapters and which, in large part, have no direct analogue in Python.

## Dynamic Memory Allocation
Dynamic memory allocation allows you to allocate memory during runtime using the `new` operator and deallocate it using the `delete` operator.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int* dynamicInt = new int(5);  // Dynamically allocate memory for an integer
    cout << "Value of dynamicInt: " << *dynamicInt << endl;
    delete dynamicInt;  // Free the allocated memory

    int* dynamicArray = new int[5];  // Dynamically allocate memory for an array
    for (int i = 0; i < 5; ++i) {
        dynamicArray[i] = i * 10;
        cout << "dynamicArray[" << i << "] = " << dynamicArray[i] << endl;
    }
    delete[] dynamicArray;  // Free the allocated memory

    return 0;
}
```

## Handling Errors
### `try`, `throw`, `catch`

In Python, to handle errors you would usually use `try`, `except` `raise`. For instance, suppose we want to validate the user's age to make sure that it is above 21 and, if the age is below this number, it throws an error. This could be implemented in Python as follows:

```{literalinclude} ../examples_py/c2_except.py
:language: python
:lineno-match:
```

What happens here is the following:
    * Python attempts running the `try` block. Inside this block, if the user inputs a number bellow 21, Python *raises* a `ValueError`, letting the user know that the age must be above 21.
    * If a `ValueError` is raised, Python runs the `except` block. Here, the program lets the user know the amounts of
